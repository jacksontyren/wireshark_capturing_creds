<h1>ðŸ”“Unlocking Insights: Capturing Clear Text Credentials Using Wireshark</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The primary objective of the lab was to simulate a scenario where potential threats could compromise sensitive information transmitted over a network. By leveraging the powerful tools Wireshark the exercise aimed to provide a practical understanding of how malicious actors might attempt to capture clear text credentials exchanged between users and applications.
